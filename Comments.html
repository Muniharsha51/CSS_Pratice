                <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to 
write Web Pages.<br>
 Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked 
together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.<br>
 As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to 
simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure 
it to display.<br>
Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like 
headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information 
between researchers.<br>
Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available 
in HTML language.<br>
Either you can use Try it option available at the top right corner of the code box to check the 
result of this HTML code, or let's save it in an HTML file test.htm using your favorite text 
editor. Finally open it using a web browser like Internet Explorer or Google Chrome, or Firefox 
etc. It must show the following output:
                <p>
            </div>
        </section>

                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Any document starts with a heading. You can use different sizes for your headings. HTML also 
                    has six levels of headings, which use the elements h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and 
                    h6. While displaying any heading, browser adds one line before and one line after that 
                    heading.<br>
                    Paragraph Tag<br>
The p tag offers a way to structure your text into different paragraphs. Each paragraph of 
text should go in between an opening p and a closing /p tag as shown below in the 
example:<br>
Line Break Tag<br>
Whenever you use the br / element, anything following it starts from the next line. This 
tag is an example of an empty element, where you do not need opening and closing tags, as 
there is nothing to go in between them.
The br / tag has a space between the characters br and the forward slash. If you omit this 
space, older browsers will have trouble rendering the line break, while if you miss the forward 
slash character and just use br it is not valid in XHTML.

                <h3 style="color: blue;">Chapter 3 :<br>Attributes</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">We have seen few HTML tags and their usage like heading tags h1, h2, paragraph tag 
                    p and other tags. We used them so far in their simplest form, but most of the HTML tags 
                    can also have attributes, which are extra bits of information.
                    An attribute is used to define the characteristics of an HTML element and is placed inside the 
                    element's opening tag. All attributes are made up of two parts: a name and a value:
                     The name is the property you want to set. For example, the paragraph p element 
                    in the example carries an attribute whose name is align, which you can use to indicate 
                    the alignment of paragraph on the page.
                    <br>
                    The value is what you want the value of the property to be set and always put within 
                    quotations. The below example shows three possible values of align attribute: left, 
                    center and right.<br>
                    Attribute names and attribute values are case-insensitive. However, the World Wide Web 
                    Consortium (W3C) recommends lowercase attributes/attribute values in their HTML 4 
                    recommendation. /p
